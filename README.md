# SSR
A repository for all our code and datafiles. Its functions are 
1: to allow us to collaborate on code.
2: to allow us to use each other's code in our own work.

To ensure smooth collaboration, all code uploaded here must adhere to 
**certain rules:**

**1 Version Control** <br>
  There should only be one version of each code, and it should be the most up to date version which does not produce errors.

**2 Portability**
  All code should be runable on everyone's computer. That means: <br>
    A.) No local path references such as r"C:\Desktop\folder\blabla.csv"
        Only paths which are in the repository are allowed: "local_copy_of_repository/folder_1/folder_2/blabla.csv" <br>
    B.) No basic errors allowed on codes uploaded to the repo. (we should be able to open and run code without having to add a parthesis or something simple) <br>

**3 Organisation** <br>
  A.) Sensible folder organisation and descriptive file names <br>
  B.) All code should have a description of what it does in the following format: <br>
    [INPUTS - PROCESS - OUTPUTS] <br>
  C.) All code should be commented.
